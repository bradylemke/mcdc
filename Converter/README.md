# MC/DC to ParaView Converter

*By Brady Lemke, Oregon State University*

Tools for viewing MC/DC problems in ParaView.
The converter turns an MC/DC input file into a geometry file and an MC/DC output (`.h5`) file into tally files, and both open directly in ParaView.

## Features

- Geometry extracted straight from the input `.py` file, without running MC/DC
- Volume tallies (flux, energy deposition, and any other score on an x, y, z mesh) written as `.vtr` and surface tallies (current) written as `.vtp`
- One command converts both the input and output file
- Works on any MC/DC input or output file, with no per-problem setup

## Requirements

- Python 3 with `numpy`, `h5py`, and `vtk`
- ParaView 6.1.1
- The converter scripts, kept together in one folder
- An MC/DC input file (`.py`) and/or output file (`.h5`) to convert

## Installation

Install the Python packages with pip:

```
pip install numpy vtk h5py
```

Download ParaView 6.1.1 for your system from [paraview.org/download](https://www.paraview.org/download/) and install it.
Skip either step if it is already installed.

## Converting Files

Open a terminal and move into the folder that holds the converter scripts:

```
cd path/to/converter_scripts
```

Run `mcdc_convert.py` with your input and output files:

```
python3 mcdc_convert.py --input your_file.py --output your_file.h5
```

Either one can be run on its own:

```
python3 mcdc_convert.py --input your_file.py
python3 mcdc_convert.py --output your_file.h5
```

The script prints its progress and writes the new files next to the input or output file it was given.
It creates the following files:

| File                            | Contents                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `your_file_geometry.vtp`        | The full geometry, plus one `_geometry.vtp` file for each shape |
| `your_file_<tally>_t000.vtr`    | Volume tally data, one file per time step                     |
| `.vtp` from the output file     | Surface-current tallies                                       |

### Running the tally scripts on their own

`--input` and `--output` are the only flags `mcdc_convert.py` takes.
To look at just the tally data, run the tally scripts directly:

```
python3 h5_to_vtr.py your_file.h5
python3 h5_to_vtp.py your_file.h5
```

To convert a single tally, put its name after the file:

```
python3 mcdc_auto_convert.py your_file.h5 tracklength_tally_0
```

For surface tallies where the box cannot be worked out automatically, `mcdc_auto_convert.py` and `h5_to_vtp.py` also take `--bounds x0 x1 y0 y1 z0 z1`.

### Supported Shapes

The geometry extractor reads these surfaces from the input file:

- Planes: `PlaneX`, `PlaneY`, `PlaneZ`
- Spheres: `Sphere`
- Cylinders: `CylinderX`, `CylinderY`, `CylinderZ`

Regions built from these with `&` (and) and `|` (or) are supported, including boxes, combined boxes, and shapes with spheres and cylinders.

If your problem uses other shapes, or you run into any issues or errors, contact me using the information at the bottom of this page.
I can look into it and add or adjust the extractor for your problem.

## The Converter Files

Only `mcdc_convert.py` is run directly.
It calls the other four.

| File                    | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mcdc_convert.py`       | Reads `--input` and `--output` and calls whichever of the other files it needs.                   |
| `extract_geometry.py`   | Reads the geometry from the input file. Tries the box reader first, then the curve reader.        |
| `mcdc_auto_convert.py`  | Checks what kind of tallies the `.h5` file has and sends them to the right converter.             |
| `h5_to_vtr.py`          | Writes volume tallies (flux, edep, and any other score on a mesh) as `.vtr`. This is the file to load first in ParaView.               |
| `h5_to_vtp.py`          | Writes surface-current tallies as `.vtp`.                                                         |

The box reader matches planes combined into a box shape, which is exact and fast.
If a cell is not a plain box, the curve reader handles spheres and cylinders using VTK boolean shapes.

## Opening Files in ParaView

1. Open ParaView.

2. Go to **File > Open**, select the `.vtr` file, and click **Apply**.

3. Change the coloring dropdown from Solid Color to the tally name (e.g. `flux`).

4. Change the representation from Outline to **Volume**.

5. Go to **File > Open** again, select the `_geometry.vtp` file, and click **Apply**.

6. Set this object's coloring back to Solid Color and lower its **Opacity** to about 0.2 to 0.3.

7. Optional: add a **Threshold** filter on the tally to hide the zero-flux cells.

## Reading Values in ParaView

To see the exact value of a cell, open a **SpreadSheet View** from the split buttons at the top right of the Render View and set **Attribute** to **Cell Data**.
Click a column header to sort, and raise **Precision** to show more digits.

To select cells in the 3D view, drag a box with one of these hotkeys:

| Key | Selects                   |
| --- | ------------------------- |
| `S` | Visible cells             |
| `D` | Visible points            |
| `F` | Cells through the volume  |
| `G` | Points through the volume |

Hold `Ctrl` (`Cmd` on Mac) to add to a selection and `Shift` to subtract.
Press `V` to open **Find Data**, which selects cells by value (e.g. `flux` `is max`).
Set the color map to log scale (**View > Color Map Editor**) so low-flux cells are visible.

### Filter Tips

**Threshold**

- Set **Scalars** to the tally name (the cell icon means cell data).
- Set the **Lower Threshold** just above 0 (e.g. `1e-30`) and the **Upper Threshold** to the data max to hide empty cells.
- To show only the hottest cells, set the lower value to the flux level you care about.
- Use the **Threshold Method** dropdown for Between, Below Lower Threshold, or Above Upper Threshold.

**Slice**

- Set **Slice Type** to Plane, then set the **Normal** to the axis you want to cut across (e.g. `0 0 1` cuts across z) and the **Origin** to where the cut sits.
- Turn on **Show Plane** to drag the cut by hand, then turn it off again.
- Click the matching axis button in the toolbar to look straight at the slice.
- Use **Slice Offset Values** to add several cuts at once.
- A slice of a volume tally keeps the cell values, so it stays blocky.
  That is the real tally mesh.

**Clip**

- Works like Slice but removes one side of the data instead of making a flat surface.
- Turn on **Crinkle clip** to keep whole cells instead of cutting them, which keeps cell values exact.
- Use **Invert** to switch which side is kept.

**Cell Data to Point Data**

- Tally values live on cells.
  This filter averages them onto the mesh points so the data can be smoothed or contoured.
- Run it before **Contour**, which needs point data.
- The values it makes are averages, not the exact tally values.
  Use the original cell data when reading exact numbers.

**Contour**

1. Select the data and run **Calculator** with **Attribute Type** set to Cell Data and the expression `log10(flux+1e-30)`, so low values spread out evenly.
2. Run **Cell Data to Point Data** on the Calculator result.
3. Run **Contour** on that result and set **Contour By** to the new array.
4. Add values in the **Isosurfaces** list, e.g. `-8`, `-6`, `-4` for flux at 1e-8, 1e-6, and 1e-4.
5. Lower the contour **Opacity** to about 0.5 so the surfaces can be seen through each other.

**Calculator**

- Set **Attribute Type** to Cell Data to work on tally values.
- The result name defaults to `Result`, so change it to something readable like `log_flux`.
- Useful expressions: `log10(flux+1e-30)` and `flux*1e6` to rescale.

**Plot Over Line**

- Set **Point1** and **Point2** to the start and end of the line, or click **Select Points On** and pick them in the 3D view.
- Set the sampling pattern to **Sample At Cell Boundaries** so the plot follows the real cell values.
- The result opens as a line chart, and the same data is in the SpreadSheet View.
- Set the chart's y axis to log scale for flux.

**Cell Centers**

- Makes a point at the middle of each cell with the cell values attached.
- Open the SpreadSheet View on it to see the x, y, z of every cell next to its value.

**Order matters**

- Each filter works on whatever is selected in the Pipeline Browser, so select the right item before adding one.
- A common chain is Threshold, then Slice, or Calculator, then Cell Data to Point Data, then Contour.
- Turn off the eye icon on the original data when a filter's output is hidden behind it.

| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The volume is blank or black                 | The coloring dropdown is probably still on Solid Color. Set it to the tally name.     |
| Everything is one color                      | Turn on log scale and set a custom range.                                             |
| Nothing changed after editing a setting      | Click **Apply**.                                                                      |
| The data disappeared after adding a filter   | Click **Reset Camera** and check the eye icon for the new item.                       |
| The geometry hides the flux                  | Lower its Opacity or turn it off.                                                     |
| Cells on the inside will not select          | Use `F` instead of `S`.                                                               |
| The geometry looks blocky                    | This is the resolution of the tally mesh, not a ParaView setting.                     |
| The converter cannot find a file             | Run the command from the folder with the scripts and pass the full path to the input or output file, e.g. `--input /path/to/your_file.py`. |
